Overview

This project applies Linear Regression to predict a person's income based on their age and experience. By training on historical salary data, the model learns relationships between experience, age, and earnings, providing valuable salary estimates.

Features

âœ… Feature Selection â€“ Uses age and experience as predictors for income.

âœ… Train-Test Split â€“ Splits data for model training & evaluation.

âœ… Linear Regression Model â€“ Fits the data and makes salary predictions.

âœ… Performance Evaluation â€“ Uses RÂ² Score to measure accuracy.

âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Plots actual vs. predicted salaries.

âœ… User Input Prediction â€“ Allows users to input age & experience to get an income estimate.

Tech Stack
